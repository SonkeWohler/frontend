# Front

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

## Tutorials Used

At first I struggled a little with JS vs TS, because I didn't expect them to be
that different.  Since everything Front-End was rather new to me (at least
everything regarding frameworks) I didn't realise when I was reading irrelevant
tutorials.

These are some tutorials that I did find useful (in retrospect, not just at the
time).

    - Of course some of their [reference manuals](https://angular.io/guide/observables)
